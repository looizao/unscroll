# Unscroll

A Chrome extension that removes algorithmic feeds and infinite scroll from YouTube, Instagram, and X (Twitter). It replaces algorithm-driven content with chronological, subscription-based feeds so you only see content from people you follow.

## What it does

### YouTube
- Redirects the home page to your **Subscriptions** feed
- Converts **Shorts** into regular video player links
- Redirects **Trending** and **Explore** to Subscriptions
- Hides Shorts shelves, sidebar links, and channel tabs

### X (Twitter)
- Forces the **Following** tab instead of "For You"
- Redirects **Explore** to Home
- Hides trending topics, "Who to follow", and all sidebar suggestions

### Instagram
- Redirects **Explore** and **Reels** to the home feed
- Hides Explore and Reels navigation links
- Removes **"Suggested for you"** posts from the feed

Each platform can be toggled on or off independently from the popup. All three are enabled by default.
